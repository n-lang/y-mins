This is the page where we tell the world about the N Language. Get prepared; a ~~journey~~ *short'n'messy text snippet* begins.

===

## Who?

- **`probit Labs`** ([@probitlabs](//github.com/probitlabs)), the intiator of the whole thing, is based in **Vienna**, Austria, currently studing at [**Popperschule**](https://www.popperschule.at/), hanging out at [**Metalab** hackerspace](https://metalab.at/) and working on **Semantic Web projects** at [**University** Vienna](http://www.univie.ac.at/).

We welcome anyone who wants to help us do good. But at the moment, we are at a very early stage of the development so that there aren't any language design drafts or contributor guides at the moment. However, [`gram.js`](//github.com/n-lang/n.js/blob/master/src/gram.js) is a good starting point as it includes ~~formal syntax specifications written using EcmaScript's template strings~~ *nothing interesting at the moment :smile:*.

## Why?

We want to create a language in which you **tell what** you think and what you want to know, **not how** to represent your thoughts as computer understandable data structures and how to exactly solve your problems.

## How?

We make extensive use of **graph-based** knowledge representation and **functional** problem descriptions.

## What?

See [`y-mins` repository](//github.com/n-lang/y-mins/) for some snippets written in N. However, at the moment, there is no way to parse or interprete.

### What The #!~§?

Jeah, looks kinda ~~cool~~ *empty*.

## When?

These are the things to get done in order to get N working:

+ [ ] Write this list about the things to do :smile:
