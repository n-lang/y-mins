This is the page where we tell the world about the N Language. Get prepared; a ~~journey~~ *short'n'messy text snippet* begins.

## Who?

- **`probit Labs`** ([@probitlabs](//github.com/probitlabs)), the intiator of the whole thing, is based in **Vienna**, Austria, currently studying at [**Popperschule**](https://www.popperschule.at/), hanging out at [**Metalab** hackerspace](https://metalab.at/) and working on **Semantic Web projects** at [**University** Vienna](http://www.univie.ac.at/).

We welcome anyone who wants to help us do good. But at the moment, we are at a very early stage of the development so that there aren't any contributor guides at the moment. Just dig into this repo and if you want to do, hear ... more, write at [`testandby@gmail.com`](mailto:testandby@gmail.com)



## Why?
We want to create a language in which you **tell what** you think and what you want to know, **not how** to represent your thoughts as computer understandable data structures and how to exactly solve your problems.



## How?
We make extensive use of **graph-based** knowledge representation and **functional** problem descriptions.



## What?
In this repo you will find:

- Design documents
    + [Syntax](syntax.md)
- Tutorials
    + [N for EcmaScriptkiddies](ecma.md)
- Code sample snippets

However, at the moment, there is no way to parse or interprete.



## When?
These are the things to get done in order to get N working:
